# Dataset contract

Each active motion directory contains one `motion.npz` and its matching
`motion.mp4`, with nonempty box or triangle-mesh terrain in the NPZ. Raw retargeting
exports and old before-refinement variants are not active dataset files.
`ground_height` alone does not count as terrain geometry.

Catalog building and validation reject missing/empty terrain, intermediate NPZs,
and clips listed as removed in `curation.json`. Mixamo references also require a
quality review tied to the current NPZ hash. Removed terrain-free files are listed
in `terrain_free_removal.json`; recoverable terrain-bearing rejects are outside
`data/`, under `outputs/quarantine/2026-10-26/`.

All bundled final references use 50 FPS, 29 named joints, and 35 body frames for
the ball-hand G1. Duration in the gallery is frame count / FPS; the last sample
time is (frame count − 1) / FPS. Body quaternions are xyzw. Positions are meters;
joint angles are radians; velocities are per second.

| Key | Shape / meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `fps` | Scalar sampling frequency |
| `joint_names`, `body_names` | Column labels |
| `joint_pos`, `joint_vel` | `(T, 29)` |
| `body_pos_w`, `body_lin_vel_w`, `body_ang_vel_w` | `(T, 35, 3)`; link origins in the reference frame |
| `body_quat_w` | `(T, 35, 4)` |
| `terrain_position` | `(N, 3)` box centers in the same reference frame |
| `terrain_dimension` | `(N, 3)` full local-axis box sizes |
| `terrain_quat` | `(N, 4)` box orientations, xyzw; optional identity |
| `terrain_vertices`, `terrain_faces` | Triangle mesh vertices and indices |
| `ground_height` | Optional ground top Z in the reference frame |
| `robot_asset` | Required asset choice for these exports |

Ground height is explicit so a global plane does not fill a jump gap. New clips
must keep terrain and motion in the same coordinate frame. Training translates
both by the same terrain-patch offset. Do not independently randomize reference
XY/yaw while leaving terrain fixed.

See the [catalog](catalog.json), [extraction manifest](import_manifest.json), and
per-clip provenance. Catalog checksums apply to the current canonical NPZ, not
the original upstream file. The metadata normalization does not change motion
arrays. Videos are kinematic visualization, not evidence of stable control.
